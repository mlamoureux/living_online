eBook - GitBook Editor

It seems I used the GitBook Editor to create the eBook Intro.syzygy.ca  Then Ian took my early draft, and added pictures and made it really nice. He may have used Hugo for that \(check\).

Some things I don't like:

* I don't know where the files are actually stored. Github? Somewhere else?
* The organization of the files seems funky. I had to work hard to keep all the pieces in order
* It is not obvious to me how to get the editor to know about MathJax.

MathJax is a piece of software that turns Latex code into properly typeset mathematics. Here is some math $$\int \cos(x) dx = \sin(x)$$

Interesting. I typed that it, and it immediately typeset it as proper mathematics. Sweet. But then when I clicked on "Save" the math went away. WTF??  And when I go away from the page, it all comes back. Weird.
