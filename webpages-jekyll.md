# Webpages - Jekyll



Jekyll is a tool used to create eBooks and webpages. I used it to create the webpage SolutionsCanada.ca  



I like some aspects of it, but:

* the organization of files gets to be a problem at some point
* not always obvious on how to turn on MathJax to display math formulas
* not clear how to link code to nbviewer and such.



To get started, you should read the webpages for Jekyll and download all the relevant software packages.

It runs on Unix and MacOS. It does seem to require that you load a lot of stuff onto your machine \(Ruby, Gems, etc\). Just go for it, load it up.
