# Introduction

This is a collection of notes on how I "do" mathematics online. Namely, what online resources I use in my day-to-day work.

Part of the issue is that I have done a large variety of tasks, so I can't remember all the details. This book is an attempt to capture all these techniques, and perhaps update them from time to time.

Topics I intend to cover

* using Markdown

* using Jupyter Notebooks and Jupyter Lab

* using nbviewer

* using Syzygy.ca

* writing an eBook \(GitBook\)

* writing an eBook \(Jekyll and Hugo\)

* writing a blog

* using Github

* using Git

* using Google Docs
