# Using Markdown

Markdown is a lightweight language for combining text and math. It let's you do some simply formating like \*italics\* and \*\*bold\*\* as well as inserting some mathematics: 

$$ \int \cos\(x\) = \sin\(x\) + B.$$





I use "MacDown" as my editor, for the MacOS.



Note you have to go to "Preferences" and select "TeX-like math syntax" as well as selecting the dollar sign for the delimiter. 



There does not seem to be a spell checker on MacDown, which is a problem.
